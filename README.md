This was thrown together in around a day, and is my first useage of .NET/C# and AWS. 

Interesting files are [here](https://github.com/romanbog/InReachDemo/blob/master/InReachDemo/Models/FileModel.cs), [here](https://github.com/romanbog/InReachDemo/blob/master/InReachDemo/Controllers/HomeController.cs), and [here](https://github.com/romanbog/InReachDemo/blob/master/InReachDemo/Views/Home/Index.cshtml)

Note that because I set up gitignore to ignore config files, this solution likley won't work when cloned.
